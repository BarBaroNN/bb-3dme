<p>Heyo folks,<br />
another leaked shit of mine that had I had to post unless these leakers will receive all the credit about script I made from scratch,<br />
<br />
anyways since I'm hosting an RP server for israeli community which their main language is hebrew that doesn't being support by GTA fonts, I had to make that with HTML so it'll support all languages such as : Hebrew, arabic, and I don't really know what else, you can customize that to your like, i'll not provide any updates or support, just drag & drop, it won't cause any problems.<br /></p>
